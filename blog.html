        <h2>Covid-19 and Education Digitisation</h2>
        <h3>How Did Digital Illiteracy Exacerbate Education Inequality during the Pandemic</h3>
        <h3>By <i>Rohana Kohli</i></h3>

            While India has made significant strides in technology and innovation, the digital divide remains a significant challenge. Needless to say, the digitisation of education during the COVID-19 pandemic raised concerns about the potential impacts of inaccessibility to IT infrastructure, such as loss of learning, higher dropout rates, and increase child labour. Undoubtedly, while online education tools provide a global reach, their accessibility is hindered by substantial economic burdens, regressively affecting marginalized communities such as girls and those living in rural areas. Today, 75% of the total students in India do not have access to the internet from any device. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The average price of EDTech products comes to around ₹20,000, proving to be unaffordable for low-income families. Moreover, 84% of households reported an income loss during the pandemic, further amplifying this issue. As a result, only 27.5% of students had access to digital devices. In addition to students, 2 out of 5 teachers reported not having access to necessary devices. Such challenges were most acutely felt by public schools in small towns and villages, owing to inadequate investment, exacerbating inequality. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, the Government of India has initiated several programs to foster digital access and literacy across the country. One such example is Digital India School, which is designed to provide digital education to students in rural areas. By subsidising computer equipment for schools in rural areas, the government can benefit from long-term gains in digital literacy and technical skills, enhancing India’s human capital. However, private contribution remains pivotal in the provision of infrastructure, training, and mentorship. Code for Change, in addition to a multitude of NGOs and corporations across the country, remains determined to contribute towards this cause, empowering our youth with digital access and opportunity!

        <h2>Corporations and Social Responsibility</h2>
        <h3>Efforts Undertaken by Large Companies to Bridge the Digital Divide </h3>

            India’s growing economy serves as a prime market for various multinational corporations, promoting foreign direct investment across sectors. As corporate social responsibility takes on greater importance in Indian society, these companies are driven towards fostering social development, with digital literacy being a primary target for tech-giants. The provision of resources, mentorship, and training by the private sector not only relieves the government of financial burden, but also incorporates efficiency and relevance to prepare students for the evolving job landscape in India.

            Google, for instance, has launched the Internet Saathi Program in collaboration with Tata Trust, empowering women from rural areas with a two-day training on digital literacy. Internet Sakhis, a term assigned to Google’s community cadre, have trained more than 240,000 community members on using smart devices, applications, and the internet. Through Internet Saakhi, Google has the unique opportunity of leveraging its growing penetration in rural India to bridge the gender divide in digital literacy.

            Furthermore, technology conglomerate Microsoft collaborated with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs to establish Project Sangam: a CSR project targeted towards upskilling Indian employees through digital education. Acknowledging the limitation of traditional classroom-based skilling among blue-collar workers who lack access to digital devices, Microsoft has built a cloud-based learning model to deliver training services via Azure. Project Sangam powered Swachh Bharat e-Learning portal has helped train 110,000+ municipal functionaries, bringing about wide-scale upskilling.

            Dell Technologies, on the other hand, focuses on helping teachers, educating them on basic computer operations through its Aarambh program. While the initiative was launched in 2016, its need was most acutely felt during the COVID-19 pandemic, as teachers across the country, particularly in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, struggled to transition to online teaching. Shifting its training model from offline to online, Dell conducted webinars with both basic and advanced modules, empowering teachers with tools and tips to make online learning more effective. Aarambh is considered a highly successful program, not only improving technological proficiency among teachers, but also motivating them to spread their acquired knowledge among their colleagues.

            With great power comes great responsibility, and multinational corporations will play a crucial role in India’s adoption of digital technologies. Projects introduced by these companies serve as an inspiration for Code for Change, as we strive to make modest strides in the attainment of digital access and literacy.
